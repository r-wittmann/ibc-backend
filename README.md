# Backend for the IBC job portal

This repository contains the code for the backend server for the IBC job portal prototype. It is developed in line with the requirements of the course Digitale Wirtschaft for the MMT masters program at LMU.

# Getting Starded

As we just need a REST API with a little logic behind it, we decided to use NodeJS with an Express web server.

    $> git clone https://github.com/r-wittmann/indoor-backend.git
    $> cd ibc-backend
    $> npm install
    $> npm run dev

This starts a web server on localhost:9090 which restarts on every code change in the project.

# Deployment

not implemented yet.
